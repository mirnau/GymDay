Hobby project in MAUI in dotnet 8.0

This is an iteration of a dotnet MAUI project that I have worked on from time to time during my studies to learn concepts in dotnet. It's basically a playground where I test out things and experiment with MVVM architecture in dotnet MAUI and unit-testing with xUnit in dotnet MAUI. The primary goal is not to end up with a product, but more so to play around and learn stuff.

The concept for the application is a simple workout application that keeps track of workouts and suggests what weights to lift in a current workout, based on data the user saves over time in the application.

Goals:

    Help the user stick to linear progression
    By gathering and analyzing data locally in a database
    To allow for an ad-hoc training schedule (by not assigning workouts to dates, but presenting them as a stack)
    And organize workout programs.

Design Goals:

    Easy to use
    Super slim
